# Policy gradient Pong for 2025

Adapt Andrej Karpathy's Pong example to Year 2025. Changes include:
1. make it work with Python3 (verified with Python 3.12)
2. use gymnasium instead of gym

Usage:
```
pip install numpy gymnasium ale-py
python pg-pong-2025.py
```

After running it overnight (25500 episodes), the trained agent can beat the computer once in a while.
